I‚Äôve spent a lot of time building products that nobody wants. I‚Äôm pretty keen for that to not continue. 

So in an attempt to fix this, I‚Äôve decided to publicly commit to validating one product every week‚Ä¶ until something works.

### Benefits
* It‚Äôs much easier to accurately plan progress/scope over a week
* You don‚Äôt accidentally spend 6 months building something (no one wants)
* Launching products is hard, but the more you do it the easier it gets
* I get to learn from my mistakes and immediately put it into practise

### Downsides
* One week might not be enough time to get a clear picture of market sentiment for the problem / solution


### 100% Open
I know this is something lots of people struggle with - so I‚Äôm going to be 100% open about my experience and progress as it happens in real time - in the hope that this helps someone else.

Here are some of the things I will share:

* A new product every week
* Lessons I learn along the way
* Failures
* Revenue and metrics
