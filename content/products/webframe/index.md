description: A directory of screenshots of beautiful web apps, to help get inspiration for your next project.
---

A showcase of beautiful and well designed web app screens for design inspiration.

## Plan
#### Problem
Inspiration is a great way to kickstart a new design, but it can be time consuming to find well designed web apps, especially as you have to sign up to each one first (before you know if it’s any good)!

#### User
A designer or product hacker looking to create new designs for their app.

#### Marketing
* ProductHunt launch
* Design forums

#### Pricing / Revenue
* Sponsored placement - we could allow people to sponsor contributions (i.e. they sponsor their page and it goes to the top of the inspiration page for that category)
* Ads - boring but it might work if we generate enough traffic
* Additional features - pay for additional features 

#### Competition
* [One Page Love](https://onepagelove.com) - only offers one page websites
* [Pttrns](https://pttrns.com)  - only for mobile apps
* [Calltoidea](https://www.calltoidea.com) - a bit unfocussed and messy - we can do better than this

#### Risks / Assumptions
* Will this generate enough traffic to be worthwhile?
* Will people pay for ads or for additional features

#### MVP
* Easy and fast way for me to upload content
* A list of categories with screenshots - e.g. billing, signup, login, etc 
* A page with the screens for a web app
* Bonus points - enable users to upload screenshots

#### Basic Plan
Day 1 - create the initial design, setup basic framework/layout<br>
Day 2 - add lots of designs (possibly allow submit if extra time)<br>
Day 3 - add feedback/validatin features - newsletter, signup<br>
Day 4 - launch the product on PH and in forums<br>
Day 5 - schedule interviews with people using the site<br>


## Log
### Day 1
☀️ 20° - Sunny intervals and a gentle breeze

Feeling good! Ok, let's get to it!

#### 10.00 - 12.20 - Plan

Create the plan that you see above.

#### 12.20 - 13.00 - Lunch

#### 13.00 - 14.00 - Design

#### 14.00 - 19.00 - Dev


#### Summary

The morning was not terribly productive - we can do better here. It also took longer than expected to get to grips wth the react-static setup, but that's because it's been a while since I've used it and some things have changed.


### Day 2

☀️ 20° - Sunny and a gentle breeze

We're a little bit behind from yesterday. Let's get to it.

  - [x] Finish the navigation / homepage for the app
  - [x] Resize images so they load faster (currently each image is ~3MB)
  - [x] Add a download button to navigatin view
  - [ ] Add a button to view all screens for an app
  - [ ] Adding a good number of examples


### Day 3

☀️ 20° - Sunny intervals and a gentle breeze

We're launching tomorrow - so today is the last dev day. Lot's to do!

  - [ ] Add a button to view all screens for an app
  - [ ] Add a good number of examples (as this may change later scope)
  - [ ] Improve category (/tag) - allow multiple tags to be selected
  - [ ] Consider adding views by industry
  - [ ] Add a fake subscribe to changes btn (to see if people want that)
  - [ ] Add a signup so people can save their favourite designs
